# TaskForge – Task and Project Management Dashboard

TaskForge is a front-end web dashboard that helps teams manage tasks, projects, and
workflows in one place. It includes tools for creating tasks, assigning team members,
tracking progress, and organizing work using a Kanban-style interface. The system uses
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and runs fully in the browser without any backend.

The dashboard supports priority tags, status updates, drag-and-drop task movement, a
modal form for editing tasks, filters, and automatic progress statistics.
